[profile.release]
# Keep the opt-level at 0 for release mode, otherwise uinput module
# does not work as expected. Currently there is no way to target only
# unix-like systems, so this profle change applies to all systems.
#
# This change does not seem to affect the running speed (ran tests with different
# opt-levels and benchmarked them with hyperfine, they all ran at very similar speeds).
# But changing the opt-level results in a small increase on the executable size.
